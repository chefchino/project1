# project1
This is our first project! Between the four of us we build an app that links events such as sports events and concerts to places to eat around the venue. This also includes a map to be more user friendly. We used Seat Geek and Street Eats to get our information as well as leaflet for the map. 
How it works:
You as the user will  put in a zip code that you are looking into. Once one the app will generate many restaurants and events in the area. As well as zooming into the area on the map so you can get an idea of where everything is relative to your current location. Click the markers on the map and a link will appear that will send you over to a website that will either let you pre-order a meal or buy tickets to the event you are interested in. This is great for a night out with friends. Catch a game and grab a bite to eat!
